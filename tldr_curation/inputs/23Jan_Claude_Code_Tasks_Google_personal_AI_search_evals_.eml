 WE'RE TURNING TODOS INTO T=
ASKS IN CLAUDE CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [6]=20

 Anthropic has upgraded Todos=
 in Claude Code to Tasks, a new primitive
that helps Claude Code track an=
d complete more complicated projects
and collaborate on them across multi=
ple sessions or subagents. Claude
can create Tasks with dependencies on e=
ach other that are stored in
the metadata, mirroring how projects work. T=
asks are stored in the
file system so that multiple subagents or sessions=
 can collaborate on
them. Updates are broadcasted to all sessions current=
ly working on the
same Task List when one session updates a Task.=20

 JANUARY 2026 (25 MINUTE READ) [8]=20

 Macro, positioning, flows, and ma=
rket structure effects were the
dominant drivers last year, particularly =
for assets outside of
Bitcoin. It was a difficult year for much of the to=
ken market, but the
year also saw advanced institutional adoption, clarif=
ied
product-market fit, and compressed valuations across large segments o=
f
the ecosystem. A strong fundamental backdrop following a year-long
be=
ar market for the broader token universe could present an
opportunity. Fo=
rward-looking setups appear increasingly asymmetric,
provided fundamental=
s stabilize and breadth returns.=20

=

 FlashAttention is an input/output aware algorithm that computes the
s=
ame mathematical result as standard attention, but more efficiently.
It u=
ses reduced memory access and near-linear memory to achieve this.
These o=
ptimizations lead to faster training and inference and enable
models to h=
andle longer sequences of tokens. FlashAttention-4, the
latest iteration =
of optimized CUDA kernels, achieves a peak
performance of 1,605 TFLOPS/s.=

 Qwen3-TTS is a series of=
 speech generation models that supports voice
cloning, voice design, ultr=
a-high-quality human-like speech
generation, and natural language-based v=
oice control. The models
support 10 mainstream languages (Chinese, Englis=

German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, and It=

various dialects. They exhibit strong contextual unders=

 SMALL MODELS, BIG RESULTS:=
 ACHIEVING SUPERIOR INTENT EXTRACTION
THROUGH DECOMPOSITION (6 MINUTE REA=
D) [13]=20

 For agents to be truly helpful, the underlying models need t=
o be able
to understand what users are trying to do when they are interac=
ting
with them. Large multimodal LLMs are already good at understanding=

user intent, but this typically involves sending information to a
serv=
er, which can be slow, costly, and carries the potential risk of
exposing=
 sensitive information. The task can be made more tractable
for small mod=
els by separating user intent understanding into two
stages.=20

 exposing sensitive information. The task can be made more tractable for sm=
all models by separating user intent understanding into two stages.
