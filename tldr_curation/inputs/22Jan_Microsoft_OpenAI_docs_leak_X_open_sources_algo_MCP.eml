 THE MICROSOFT-OPENAI FILES: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS RE=

OF AI'S DEFINING ALLIANCE (27 MINUTE READ) [5]=20

 =
Elon Musk's lawsuit accusing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of
abandoning =
the nonprofit mission has unveiled over 200 documents that
offer an insid=
e look into the relationship between OpenAI and
Microsoft. Musk, an OpenA=
I co-founder, is seeking up to $134 billion
in damages, with a jury trial=
 scheduled for this Spring. The files
reveal how Microsoft pursued, rebuf=
fed, and backed OpenAI at various
moments over the past decade. The previ=
ously undisclosed emails,
messages, slide decks, reports, and deposition =
transcripts show how
Microsoft ultimately shaped the course of the lab th=
at launched the
generative AI era.=20

 X has open sourced its algorithm, giving the world a peek behind th=

company's algorithmic curtain. The site's algorithm considers
engagem=
ent history and surveys recent in-network posts when finding
content for =
individual users. It conducts a machine-learning-based
analysis of 'out o=
f network' posts that it believes the user might
also find appealing. The=
 algorithm then filters out certain kinds of
posts, as well as content de=
emed too violent or spam-like, and ranks
the content based on what it thi=
nks users will find most appealing.=20

patients by 49% when used in
combination with Merck's immunotherapy Keytr=

using Keytruda alone. The results illustrate mRNA's=
 potential in
cancer care. The treatment continues to demonstrate sustain=

clinically meaningful improvement. The companies are currently run=

eight Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials across multiple tumor type=

 The International Space =
Station is due to be decommissioned in less

 yet to formally publish rules and
requirements for a potential replaceme=

main contenders for NASA's commercial space =

 Space. NASA is
expected to select one or two of these companies for cont=

 MCP, SKILLS, AND AG=

 Harnesses are constantly improving by ite=
rating on what works well.
However, every time someone releases a new beh=
avior, the thought
leaders of the internet determine that it has replaced=
 all previous
functionality. Developers should try both skills and MCP to=
 learn the
fundamentals of how the technology works and what that means f=
or

depends entirely on the workflows they help people solve.=20

 I'M ADDICTED TO BEING USE=

 People think software engineers are addicte=

by an addiction to solving puzzles, or drawn by=
 power and money. What

compulsion. It's worth figuring out what really motivate=

ENTIC AI AND THE MYTHICAL AGENT-MONTH (6 MINUTE READ) [14]=20

 The conce=
pt of 'Scalable Agency', where a developer could
theoretically spin up th=
ousands of agents to complete tasks faster,
relies on a flawed assumption=
 that software engineering is an
embarrassingly parallel task. Context lo=
ading is not the same as
common knowledge, and reading tokens is not the =
same as understanding
the causal chain of changes across a system. Adding=
 manpower to a late
software project makes it later. Multi-agent systems =
do not escape
this law, they simply hit the wall of state-space explosion=
 faster
than humans do.=20

 its CEO Sam Altman of abandoning the nonprofit mission has unveiled over 2=

                                    Harnesses are constantly improving by i=
terating on what works well. However, every time someone releases a new beh=
avior, the thought leaders of the internet determine that it has replaced a=
ll previous functionality. Developers should try both skills and MCP to lea=
rn the fundamentals of how the technology works and what that means for man=
aging the context window. How the technologies shift in the future depends =
entirely on the workflows they help people solve.

                                    The concept of 'Scalable Agency', where=
 a developer could theoretically spin up thousands of agents to complete ta=
sks faster, relies on a flawed assumption that software engineering is an e=
mbarrassingly parallel task. Context loading is not the same as common know=
ledge, and reading tokens is not the same as understanding the causal chain=
 of changes across a system. Adding manpower to a late software project mak=
es it later. Multi-agent systems do not escape this law, they simply hit th=
e wall of state-space explosion faster than humans do.
