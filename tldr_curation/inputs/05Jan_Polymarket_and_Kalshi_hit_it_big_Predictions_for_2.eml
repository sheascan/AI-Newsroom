 =
POLYMARKET AND KALSHI HIT IT BIG ON 2025 FINTECH FUNDING SURGE (5
MINUTE =
READ) [4]=20

 Venture investment into fintech rebounded in 2025 after a =
four-year
slump, driven largely by a surge of capital flowing into predic=
tion
markets amid growing interest in regulated online wagering. Polymark=
et
and Kalshi alone raised $3.7 billion, securing two of the largest US=

fintech rounds of the year and signaling a sharp concentration of
fund=
ing among perceived category leaders. The trend reflects a broader
shift =
in venture behavior, with investors favoring scaled winners like
Ramp as =
fintech funding remains far below its 2021 peak despite
improving regulat=
ory tailwinds.=20

 HOW BOTS, BANKING, AND STABLECOINS WILL DOMINATE FINT=
ECH IN 2026 (5
MINUTE READ) [5]=20

 Fintech leaders expect 2026 to mar=
k a shift as more companies pursue
bank charters, expand stablecoin-based=
 payments, and deploy AI agents
that can complete purchases on consumers'=
 behalf. With a more
permissive regulatory backdrop in the US, firms like=
 Coinbase, Stripe,
Mercury, Visa, and Mastercard are positioning for a fu=
ture where
fintechs operate closer to the core banking system while stabl=
ecoins
and agentic commerce move into the mainstream.=20

 CATHIE WOOD'=

 Cathie Wood's ARK Blockchain & Fintech Innovation ETF returned abo=
ut
29% in 2025 by broadening its definition of fintech and adding
AI-li=
nked stocks such as Palantir and Roku, while traditional payments
and cry=
pto names lagged. The strategy helped ARK outperform rival
fintech ETFs d=
uring a down year for payments and digital assets,
though investor flows =
into the fund remained largely flat despite the
strong performance.=20

 FINTECH GROWS UP: THE GREA=
T RACE TO BECOME A BANK (7 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Fintech's surge in OCC=
 charter applications marks a coming-of-age
moment as companies like Merc=
ury, Stripe, and Circle move from
sponsor-bank dependency to owning the r=
ails for better economics,
control, and legitimacy. At the same time, oth=
ers like Ramp, Brex, and
Navan are opting out, betting that the real valu=
e sits in software and
workflow layers, creating a sharp split between ve=

 QED INVESTORS SHARES AI AND FINTECH OUTLOOK FOR 2026 (4 MINUTE READ)=

[8]=20

 QED Investors sees 2026 as a turning point where AI shifts fr=
om
experimentation to execution across fintech, with dynamic credit
sco=
ring, workflow automation, and disciplined growth moving to the
forefront=
. The firm expects alternative data and continuously updated
underwriting=
 models to expand access to credit, while warning that
early AI traction =
is often mistaken for defensible advantage as
competition rapidly compres=
ses margins. Looking ahead, QED believes
valuations will normalize as AI =
unit economics become clearer,
rewarding companies that own deep workflow=
s, integrations, and trust
rather than those relying on =E2=80=9CAI magic=
=E2=80=9D alone.=20

 SIX FINTECH STARTUP PREDICTIONS FOR 2026 (6 MINUTE =
READ) [9]=20

 Alex Lazarow argues that fintech's next phase will be defi=
ned less by
hype and faster scaling, and more by depth, discipline, and h=
ard
trade-offs. He predicts slower global expansion but faster copycat
=
replication, rising AI-driven capital efficiency that reshapes
early-stag=
e funding norms, and an overdue reckoning as AI churn
exposes fragile rev=
enue models and inflated valuations. Looking ahead
to 2026, winners are l=
ikely to be companies that prioritize local
execution, valuation restrain=
t, M&A-led growth, and hybrid
tech-plus-services models over noisy growth=
-at-all-costs strategies.=20

 OPEN STANDARDS WILL UNLOCK AGENTIC AI'S NE=
XT BREAKTHROUGH IN FINTECH
(7 MINUTE READ) [10]=20

 Agentic AI has beg=
un reshaping fintech operations, but the industry's
fragmentation with di=
vergent APIs and data formats risks locking in
siloed solutions unless st=
akeholders adopt open standards that let AI
agents work across systems. T=
he formation of the Agentic AI Foundation
(AAIF) and growing protocols li=
ke the Model Context Protocol (MCP) are
early steps toward interoperabili=
ty that could unlock richer
cross-platform workflows and more meaningful =
automation. With shared
schemas and governance frameworks, next-generatio=
n agentic systems
could orchestrate tasks across payroll, banking, paymen=
ts, and
forecasting, leveling the playing field for smaller fintechs and=

enabling innovation beyond proprietary stacks.=20

 CARF ACTIVATES GLOBAL CRYPTO TAX REPORTING ACROSS=
 48 COUNTRIES (3
MINUTE READ) [11]=20

 As of January 1, the OECD's Cry=
pto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)
requires crypto service providers to=
 report user transaction data
annually, bringing crypto under a coordinat=
ed global tax transparency
regime. Starting in 2027, participating jurisd=
ictions will
automatically exchange this data cross-border, significantly=
 reducing
the ability to hide assets in crypto and aligning digital asset=
s with
traditional financial reporting standards.=20

 MERCURY APPLIES =
FOR OCC BANK CHARTER AS FINTECH PUSHES DEEPER INTO
REGULATED BANKING (3 M=
INUTE READ) [12]=20

 Mercury has applied for a national bank charter wit=
h the OCC and
appointed former SoFi Bank CFO Jon Auxier as CEO of the pro=
posed bank,
signaling a major step toward becoming a fully regulated fina=
ncial
institution. If approved, the charter would allow Mercury to hold=

deposits directly, operate as an FDIC-insured bank, and expand product=

innovation while reducing reliance on partner banks.=20

 AI WILL DEMOLISH 200,000 JOBS ACCORDING TO EX=

 Morgan Stanley estimates that the adopti=

could eliminate about 200,000 banking jobs =
across the European Union
by 2030, especially in back-office, middle-offi=
ce, compliance, and
risk roles, highlighting AI's potential to reshape wo=
rk in established
sectors. While some leaders stress that AI will also cr=
eate new
opportunities and support work-life improvements like shorter wo=

weeks, the looming cuts underscore broader debates over automation's=

dual impact on job displacement and economic productivity.=20

                                    Venture investment into fintech rebound=
ed in 2025 after a four-year slump, driven largely by a surge of capital fl=
owing into prediction markets amid growing interest in regulated online wag=
ering. Polymarket and Kalshi alone raised $3.7 billion, securing two of the=
 largest US fintech rounds of the year and signaling a sharp concentration =
of funding among perceived category leaders. The trend reflects a broader s=
hift in venture behavior, with investors favoring scaled winners like Ramp =
as fintech funding remains far below its 2021 peak despite improving regula=
tory tailwinds.

operations, but the industry's fragmentation with divergent APIs and data f=
ormats risks locking in siloed solutions unless stakeholders adopt open sta=
ndards that let AI agents work across systems. The formation of the Agentic=
 AI Foundation (AAIF) and growing protocols like the Model Context Protocol=
 (MCP) are early steps toward interoperability that could unlock richer cro=
