 1X has integrated its new video-pretra=

its NEO robot platform. The 1XWM model predi=
cts robot actions by
generating text-conditioned video rollouts and then =
translating them
into motion commands through an Inverse Dynamics Model. =
It uses a 14B
parameter generative video model as a backbone, with infere=
nce
currently taking about 11 seconds per rollout. The method enables
f=
aster adaptation to new tasks as it doesn't require tens of thousands

                                    1X has integrated its new video-pretrai=
ned world model, 1XWM, into its NEO robot platform. The 1XWM model predicts=
 robot actions by generating text-conditioned video rollouts and then trans=
lating them into motion commands through an Inverse Dynamics Model. It uses=
 a 14B parameter generative video model as a backbone, with inference curre=
ntly taking about 11 seconds per rollout. The method enables faster adaptat=
ion to new tasks as it doesn't require tens of thousands of robot demonstra=
tion hours.
