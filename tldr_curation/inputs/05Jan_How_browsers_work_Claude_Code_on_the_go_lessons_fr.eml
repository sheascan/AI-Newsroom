 ESSENTIAL=
 USER MANAGEMENT FEATURES FOR STARTUPS (SPONSOR) [4]=20

 Startups need s=
olid user management from day one: authentication
(passwords, OAuth, magi=
c links), authorization with role-based access
control, profile managemen=
t, and security essentials like MFA and
session handling. These features =
directly impact conversion rates,
reduce support tickets, and keep you co=
mpliant with data protection
regulations.

This guide [4] breaks down=
 what to prioritize based on your stage,
when to use an auth provider ver=
sus building in-house, and how to
avoid common pitfalls like insecure pas=
sword storage or broken session
management.

re evaluating auth solutions or planning your
user management architectur=

 HOW BROWSERS WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [5]=20

 This interac=
tive guide provides a simplified mental model of how
browsers function, u=
sing small, interactive examples. It explains how
browsers process URLs, =
convert them into HTTP requests, and resolve
domain names into IP address=
es using DNS. A reliable TCP connection is
established to the server for =
sending HTTP requests and receiving
responses. Finally, the browser parse=
s HTML to build the DOM tree and
render the page through layout, paint, a=
nd composite stages.=20

 SOFTWARE RENDERING IN 500 LINES OF BARE C++ (3 =
MINUTE READ) [6]=20

 This article series makes modern 3D graphics APIs u=
nderstandable
through building a simplified software renderer in bare C++=
 from
scratch. The project has about 500 lines of code and requires no
=
third-party graphics libraries. The series starts with basic pixel
manipu=
lation and TGA file handling, then moves on to manually learning
to draw =
lines, triangles, and perform complex rendering tasks.=20

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 21 LESSONS FROM 14 YEARS AT GOOGLE (12 MI=
NUTE READ) [7]=20

 After 14 years at Google, Addy Osmani has found value=
 in obsessing
over solving user problems, collaborating to get to the rig=
ht answer
together, and having a strong bias towards action and shipping =
clear,
simple solutions. Clarity is more important than cleverness, and i=
t's
always good to question the necessity of new code.=20

 SHIPPING AT=
 INFERENCE-SPEED (8 MINUTE READ) [8]=20

 AI-powered coding has accelerat=
ed this dev's software development
speed, with GPT-5/5.2 Codex being a ma=
jor breakthrough that allows
them to ship code at "inference-speed.=
=E2=80=9D This means they are limited
mainly by AI processing time rather=
 than human coding ability. GPT's
Codex takes longer to start (sometimes =
10-15 minutes reading code),
but it produces more reliable results than C=
laude's Opus, which works
faster but often requires fixes. They now rarel=
y read the code they
produce, instead focusing on high-level architecture=
 decisions and
letting AI handle most implementation details.=20

 WHAT=
 THE BEST ENGINEERS DO=E2=80=94AND WHAT ACTUALLY GOT THEM PROMOTED,
FROM =
AN AMAZON VP (8 MINUTE READ) [9]=20

 According to former Amazon VP Ethan=
 Evans, the best engineers who get
promoted aren't just great coders, but=
 those who make the entire
organization better by focusing on business im=
pact rather than just
technical excellence. The top engineers fully ship =
products (not just
demos), make the organization faster through high prod=
uctivity and
proactivity, do their share of unglamorous work, help others=
 succeed,
and communicate properly about customer impact.=20

 REACT GRAB (GITHUB =
REPO) [11]=20

 React Grab improves the accuracy and speed of AI coding a=
gents by
allowing devs to directly select UI element context from their R=
eact
apps. Users can hover over any UI element and press a hotkey (=
=E2=8C=98C or
Ctrl+C) to copy its file name, React component, and HTML so=
urce code.
This capability provides precise context to AI tools, making t=
hem much
faster and more accurate in understanding and modifying code. =


 TAWS (GITHUB REPO) [12]=20

 taws is a terminal UI for interacting=
 with AWS resources. It lets
users navigate, observe, and manage their in=
frastructure directly from
the command line. taws has a keyboard-driven i=
nterface with real-time
updates, multi-profile/region support, and covera=

 C3 is a safe programm=
ing language designed as an evolution of C,
building on its syntax and se=
mantics. It has full C ABI compatibility,
allowing for easy integration w=
ith existing C/C++ projects without
special considerations. C3 includes a=
 simple module system, precise
operator overloading, powerful compile-tim=
e macros, gradual contracts,
zero-overhead error handling, and generic mo=
dules.=20

 THE DICTATOR'S HANDBOOK=
 AND THE POLITICS OF TECHNICAL COMPETENCE (13
MINUTE READ) [14]=20

 "T=
he Dictator's Handbook=E2=80=9D is a political science book that says
tha=
t leaders maintain power by rewarding a coalition of insiders, with
the s=
ize of this coalition determining an organization's governance
style and =
outcomes. This framework can be applied to the internal
politics of large=
 tech companies, especially at the individual
engineer and manager levels=
. However, unlike the book's premise,
technical competence is an importan=
t "currency" in engineering, so
competence politics plays a far more sign=
ificant role for mid-level
leaders focused on achieving tangible results.=

 IS AGENTIC METADATA THE NEXT INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER? (13 MINUTE READ)=

[15]=20

 AI agents generate "agentic metadata," which includes rich d=
ata like
reasoning traces, user prompts, and tool calls. This metadata is=

invaluable for debugging, continuous improvement, cost optimization,
a=
nd governance and compliance. However, effectively collecting,
storing, a=
nd operationalizing this fragmented data has a lot of
challenges.=20

 This is a catalog of real-world agentic AI patterns, =

 THE FUTURE OF AGENTIC CODING: CONDUCTORS TO ORCHES=
TRATORS (30 MINUTE

 The future of agentic coding will tr=
ansform software engineers from
direct implementers into "conductors" gui=
ding single AI assistants and
increasingly into "orchestrators" managing =
autonomous fleets of agents
to speed up software development.=20

                                    This interactive guide provides a simpl=
ified mental model of how browsers function, using small, interactive examp=
les. It explains how browsers process URLs, convert them into HTTP requests=
, and resolve domain names into IP addresses using DNS. A reliable TCP conn=
ection is established to the server for sending HTTP requests and receiving=
 responses. Finally, the browser parses HTML to build the DOM tree and rend=
er the page through layout, paint, and composite stages.

not just demos), make the organization faster through high productivity and=

                                    "The Dictator's Handbook=E2=80=9D is a =
political science book that says that leaders maintain power by rewarding a=
 coalition of insiders, with the size of this coalition determining an orga=
nization's governance style and outcomes. This framework can be applied to =
the internal politics of large tech companies, especially at the individual=
 engineer and manager levels. However, unlike the book's premise, technical=
 competence is an important "currency" in engineering, so competence politi=
cs plays a far more significant role for mid-level leaders focused on achie=
ving tangible results.

which includes rich data like reasoning traces, user prompts, and tool call=

optimization, and governance and compliance. However, effectively collectin=
