GA IPO (5 MINUTE READ) [5]=20

 At least three of the most valuable and h=
ighest-profile tech
companies are currently preparing to list their share=
s on the public
market. Anthropic, OpenAI, and SpaceX have all taken earl=
y steps to go
public. Any of these companies would be among the most valu=
able ever
to go public. The listings could create an enormous bonanza for=
 Wall

 SpaceX has announced plans for a potential uncrewe=
d mission to Mars
as early as late 2026. The proposed schedule coincides =
with a rare
planetary alignment between Earth and Mars that offers a narr=
ow but
valuable launch opportunity. Several core technologies essential t=
o
deep space travel remain in development. Starship Version 3 is
expect=

pivotal to=
 long-duration missions beyond Earth orbit.=20

 GENETIC THERAPY AIMS TO =
BRING HEARING TO THOSE BORN DEAF (3 MINUTE
READ) [8]=20

 OTOF-related =
hearing loss results from a genetic change in a single
critical protein. =
The auditory nerve fails to receive the proper
signals from the hair cell=
s in the ear due to the lack of the proper
protein, resulting in profound=
 deafness. DB-OTO is a virus-based gene
therapy that can deliver a workin=
g version of the OTOF gene. It uses a
non-pathogenic virus to carry the p=
roper genetic code that produces
the protein. In an early trial of the DB=
-OTO treatment, eleven out of
twelve patients developed improved hearing =
within weeks, and nine
patients no longer required cochlear implants.=20

 55% of knowledge workers are putting in more ho=

less. The culprit? Well over half say that fragmentati=

 SCALING LONG-RUNNING AUTONOMOUS CODING (6=

 Model choice matters for extremely long-running t=
asks. GPT-5.2 models
perform better at extended autonomous work compared =
to Opus 4.5 and
GPT-5.1-codex. Many improvements come from removing compl=
exity rather
than adding it. The best system is often simpler than you'd =
expect.
The harness and models matter, but the prompts matter more.=20

 JUNIOR DEVELOPERS IN THE AGE OF AI (8 MINUTE READ) [11]=20

 The most=
 compelling reason to hire juniors is AI itself. The biggest
barrier to A=
I transformation has been workforce buy-in. Gen Z leads in
AI adoption, a=
nd they act as an accelerant, helping colleagues learn
AI tools and workf=
lows. AI has lowered the cost of onboarding. If the
infrastructure alread=
y exists, hiring juniors may be one of the
highest-leverage AI bets avail=
able today.=20

                                    OTOF-related hearing loss results from =
a genetic change in a single critical protein. The auditory nerve fails to =
receive the proper signals from the hair cells in the ear due to the lack o=
f the proper protein, resulting in profound deafness. DB-OTO is a virus-bas=
ed gene therapy that can deliver a working version of the OTOF gene. It use=
s a non-pathogenic virus to carry the proper genetic code that produces the=
 protein. In an early trial of the DB-OTO treatment, eleven out of twelve p=
atients developed improved hearing within weeks, and nine patients no longe=
r required cochlear implants.

                                    Long-horizon agents allow models to tak=
e actions and iterate over time. The rate of progress in this area of resea=

be able to hire agents - one of the litmus tests for AGI.
