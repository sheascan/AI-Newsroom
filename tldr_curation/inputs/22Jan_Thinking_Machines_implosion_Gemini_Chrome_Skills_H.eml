 DEEPMIND CEO SAYS CHINESE AI FIRMS ARE=

MINUTE READ) [5]=20

 Google DeepMind's CE=
O, Demis Hassabis, says that Chinese AI companies
remain around six month=
s behind the frontier AI of the leading Western
labs. He says the respons=
e to DeepSeek's R1 model last year was a
massive overreaction and that wh=
ile Chinese firms are very good at
catching up to the frontier, they have=
 yet to show they can innovate
beyond that. Some of the barriers to Chine=
se AI development are set to
come down as the Trump administration is eas=
ing a ban on advanced AI
chip exports to China. Sales of the most advance=

remain blocked on national security grounds.=20

 WITHOUT BENCHMARKING LLMS, Y=
OU'RE LIKELY OVERPAYING 5-10X (10 MINUTE
READ) [9]=20

 Those paying fo=
r LLM APIs and have never tested alternatives are
likely overpaying. Ther=
e are almost always cheaper options with
comparable quality for every wor=
kflow. Benchmarking and finding an
optimal model is a complex process, bu=
t it can result in significant
savings. This post discusses how one team =
navigated the process to
save thousands of dollars.=20

 THE TRAGEDY OF=
 THE AGENTIC COMMONS (14 MINUTE READ) [10]=20

 AI agents can improve mat=
ching markets, like dating or job searches,
by using LLMs to convert unst=
ructured preferences into actionable
data, outperforming standard questio=
nnaires. However, in markets where
everyone uses AI agents, congestion in=
creases significantly, reducing
efficiency without a pricing mechanism. I=
ntroducing prices and
institutional design can alleviate congestion, stre=
amline
coordination, and enhance market efficiency.=20

says that Chinese AI companies remain around six months behind the frontier=
 AI of the leading Western labs. He says the response to DeepSeek's R1 mode=

y good at catching up to the frontier, they have yet to show they can innov=

come down as the Trump administration is easing a ban on advanced AI chip e=
xports to China. Sales of the most advanced AI processors will remain block=

Q3 2025 shows a 4.9% productivity jump, with minimal change in hours worked=
, indicating potential initial AI-driven efficiency gains. Despite early-st=
age adoption, these developments could significantly boost economic product=

the decision to allow Nvidia to sell GPUs to Chinese companies to giving nu=
clear weapons to an adversary. The Trump administration announced just over=
 a month ago that it would allow shipments of Nvidia H200 accelerators to C=
hinese customers as long as the US received 25% of the revenues. Chinese au=
thorities have yet to allow local buyers to acquire the GPUs. Anthropic wan=
ts stricter controls on AI exports, saying access to the chips would put Ch=
inese model developers in a better position to compete with the West.
