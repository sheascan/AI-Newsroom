 SENTR=
Y'S AI DEBUGGER USES YOUR ACTUAL ERROR DATA =E2=80=93 NOT JUST CODE
(SPON=

 Most AI coding tools only see your source code. Seer, Sentr=
y's AI
debugging agent [4], sees everything Sentry knows: stack traces, l=
ogs,
breadcrumbs, spans, commit history, and the full error context. That=
's
why it can pinpoint root causes with 95% accuracy [4] =E2=80=93 even i=
n
parts of your codebase you've never touched.

HOW IT WORKS:

 =
=09* Sentry logs an issue.
 =09* Seer analyzes it using all available con=
text.
 =09* Seer suggests a fix, opens a PR automatically, or writes unit=

tests to prevent regressions.

Seer also scans issues and assigns ac=
tionability scores, so teams know
which bugs are most likely to be fixabl=
e with a code change.

 DIGITAL RED QUEEN: =
ADVERSARIAL PROGRAM EVOLUTION IN CORE WAR WITH
LLMS (13 MINUTE READ) [8] =


 Core War is a competitive programming game in which battle programs=

fight for dominance inside a virtual computer. This study explores
wha=
t happens when large language models drive an adversarial
evolutionary ar=
ms race where programs continuously adapt to defeat a
growing history of =
opponents rather than a static benchmark. The
dynamic adversarial process=
 led to the emergence of increasingly
general strategies. The Core War sa=
ndbox offers a safe and controlled
environment for analyzing how AI agent=
s might evolve in real-world
adversarial settings such as cybersecurity. =

 The AI industry has announced more than half a trillion dollars of=

commitmen=
ts, but the disclosed language and missing definitions make
many of them =
look more like optionality dressed up as commitment. The
refusal to stand=
ardize terms, define units, and allow any market-based
verification sugge=

is expensive. The mark=

 WHEN AI WR=

(12 MINUTE RE=
AD) [10]=20

 AI models like Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 now write most software=
 code,
prompting a shift in software engineering practices. This reduces =
the
value of language expertise and routine coding tasks while increasing=

the demand for tech leads who are product-minded. Although AI can
hand=
le more of the coding workload, engineers will need to oversee
complex ta=
sks, emphasizing a hybrid skill set in both product
management and techni=
cal expertise.=20

 growing history of opponents rather than a static benchmark. The dynamic a=

 The Core War sandbox offers a safe and controlled environment for analyzin=

                                    The AI industry has announced more than=
 half a trillion dollars of infrastructure commitments over the past year. =
The headline figures are being priced as if they represent binding, time-ce=
rtain capex commitments, but the disclosed language and missing definitions=
 make many of them look more like optionality dressed up as commitment. The=
 refusal to standardize terms, define units, and allow any market-based ver=
ification suggests the participants prefer a world where scrutiny is expens=
ive. The market is being asked to trust without the tools to verify.
