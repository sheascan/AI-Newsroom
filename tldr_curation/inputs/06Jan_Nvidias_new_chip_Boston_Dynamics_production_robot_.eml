 designed to fulfill AI requests more quickly and

years. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Hua=

surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous=

400 M=

 Dried b=

the brain ch=
anges linked to Alzheimer's. Researchers have developed a
dried blood tes=
t that, while less accurate than traditional blood
tests, showed good abi=
lity to distinguish people with
Alzheimer's-related disease. The method i=
s cheaper than traditional
testing and could potentially be performed out=
side of clinical
settings. The same technique could potentially be used t=
o detect other
conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lat=
eral
sclerosis.=20

agent operates. Agen=

rchers have developed a dried blood test that, while less accurate than tra=
