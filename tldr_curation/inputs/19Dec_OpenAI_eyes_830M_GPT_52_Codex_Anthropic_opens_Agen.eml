 The buzz arou=

coding, most impl=

 Meta i=

Mango. The=
 model is expected to be released in the first half of 2026.
Image genera=

INSTITUTIONS (51 MINUTE VIDEO) [8]=20
=

 John Schulman estimates that with full hindsight, a few talented
peop=
le could have built a ChatGPT-3.5-level model in 2018-2019 with a
couple =
of GPU boxes. He described early OpenAI as a "rag tag" blend of
small exp=
loratory research projects and bigger engineering efforts
inspired by Dee=
pMind's AlphaGo. He expects value functions and offline
RL to make a come=
back, and warns that catch-up mode makes it harder to
build exploratory r=
esearch culture later.=20

 AI #147: FLASH FORWARD (93 MINUTE READ) [9] =


 GPT-5.2 is a frontier model only for the frontier. OpenAI's image 1.=

looks comparable to Nano Banana Pro, and the startup has a deal for
D=
isney's characters. Gemini 3 Flash is a good model for its speed and
pric=

a low p=
rice.=20

 EVALUATING CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT MONITORABILITY (15 MINUTE READ) [1=

 OpenAI has proposed a new evaluation suite to measure how reliabl=
y
model reasoning can be monitored via chains-of-thought. The study
ass=
essed monitorability across 24 environments and found that
reasoning tran=
sparency can vary significantly with scale,
reinforcement learning, and i=
nference-time compute.=20

 AGENT SKILLS BECOMES AN OPEN STANDARD (2 MINUTE READ=

 Agent Skills, folders of instructions, scripts, and resources=
 that
give AI agents new capabilities on demand, originated at Anthropic=

(which also created MCP) and is now an open format with adoption from
=
Cursor, GitHub, VS Code, Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex CLI. Skills

teams package domain expertise and workflows into portable,
version-contr=
olled packages that work across different agent products.

 Replit built a compute and storage fabric that allows it to make=

changes in an isolated, reversible way. These primitives enable
develo=
pers to experiment more frequently and faster. The company
realized the s=
ame primitives could be used to superpower coding agents
when it built Re=
plit Agent in 2024. The system helps the human driving
the agent, and the=
 agent itself greatly benefits from the tools. This

low-quality scans, and tables. Mistral OCR 3 enables d=

 Scale AI researchers developed a structured approach to reinforcement=

hindsight, a few talented people could have built a ChatGPT-3.5-level model=

                                    Mistral OCR 3 is designed to extract te=
xt and embedded images from a wide range of documents with exceptional fide=
lity. It is a major upgrade over the previous version in forms, handwritten=
 content, low-quality scans, and tables. Mistral OCR 3 enables downstream s=
ystems to understand structure as well as document content. The model can b=
e integrated via API and used with Document AI, a UI that parses documents =
into text or structured JSON.

if not done well. Anthropic chose to re-render only the changed parts. It r=
ewrote the renderer from scratch while still keeping React as the component=
 model.
