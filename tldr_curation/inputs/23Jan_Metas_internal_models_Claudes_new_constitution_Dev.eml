 Anthropic has =

is a detailed descr=
iption of Anthropic's vision for Claude's values
and behavior that explai=
ns the context in which Claude operates and
the kind of entity the compan=

constitution is a crucial part of the mode=

 M=

can be delivered in a way =
that's usable internally and by consumers.
Meta is starting to see favora=

 PASS@K IS MOSTLY BUNK (3 MINUTE READ) [9]=20
=

 Pass@k is the probability that at least one of k different attempts
w=
ill succeed. It is one of the most common metrics used for agents.
The pr=
oblem with the metric is that it's exponentially forgiving, and
humans in=
teracting with agents aren't nearly that forgiving. Pass@k
should be a me=
tric that's rarely used, and carefully justified every
time it is used. =
