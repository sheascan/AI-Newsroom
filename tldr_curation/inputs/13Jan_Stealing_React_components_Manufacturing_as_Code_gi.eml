ESIGNAT=
URE (SPONSOR) [4]=20

 Many developers know Docusign as "the signature th=
ing." But under the
hood, there's a complete platform [4] for building in=
telligent
agreement workflows.

The Docusign Developer Center [4] giv=
es access to 400+ API endpoints
across eSignature, workflow automation (M=
aestro), AI-extracted
agreement data (Navigator), web forms, and more. SD=
Ks are available in
C#, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

The pl=
atform also supports extensions =E2=80=93 custom apps that plug
directly =
into Docusign to verify data, sync with external systems, or
connect to c=
loud storage.

Adding contract management to a SaaS product? Automating=
 document
flows for an internal tool? Whatever you're building, the APIs =
and
tooling are already there.

 HOW TO STEAL ANY REACT COMPONENT (6 MINUTE READ) [5]=20

 It's=
 possible to "steal" or reconstruct any React component from a
production=
 website, even without access to its source code. React
Fiber is an inter=
nal tree structure in the browser that exposes which
components create sp=
ecific DOM elements and what props they receive.
You can generate a compo=
nent's code by collecting multiple examples of
a component's props and it=
s resulting HTML and feeding it into an LLM.


 HOW TO BUILD AGENTS W=
ITH FILESYSTEMS AND BASH (3 MINUTE READ) [6]=20

 A simple, effective arc=
hitecture for AI agents is a standard
filesystem and Bash tools. Since LL=
Ms have a native understanding of
code and Unix commands, agents can easi=
ly navigate and retrieve
information from data structured as files, much =
like exploring a
codebase. This approach overcomes the limitations of pro=
mpt stuffing
and imprecise vector search by offering natural data hierarc=
hies,
exact retrieval, and minimal context loading.=20

 REPLACING LLM =
DATE MATH WITH DETERMINISTIC SCRIPTS TO IMPROVE
CALENDAR ACCURACY (3 MINU=
TE READ) [7]=20

 LLMs like Claude frequently fail at date math, causing =
calendar
errors in tools like gcalcli. Offloading calculations to determi=
nistic
scripts ensures accuracy. Developers can eliminate hallucinations =
and
create reliable, repeatable AI workflows by updating CLAUDE.md
inst=
ructions to execute code instead of manual reasoning.=20

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ANTHROPIC MADE A BIG MISTAKE (6 MINUTE READ) =
[8]=20

 Anthropic recently made a business blunder by closing a loophole=
 that
allowed customers to use their cheaper subscription models with
p=
opular third-party coding agents like OpenCode. This move alienated
many =
paying customers who felt they were unjustly restricted from
using a serv=
ice they already purchased. OpenAI capitalized on this by
officially supp=
orting its own subscriptions within these same
third-party agents.=20

=
 THE GREAT FILTER (OR WHY HIGH PERFORMANCE STILL ELUDES MOST DEV
TEAMS, E=
VEN WITH AI) (7 MINUTE READ) [9]=20

 Despite the rise of AI-assisted cod=
ing, there's no widespread
evidence of increased developer productivity o=
r business value. DORA
data shows that only already high-performing teams=
 see benefits, while
AI often slows down inefficient ones. The key differ=
entiator for
high-performing teams is addressing development process bott=
lenecks by
adopting continuous, small-batch software work with tight feed=
back
loops.=20

 BUILD API KEY=
 AUTHENTICATION FOR YOUR SAAS WITH CLERK (SPONSOR) [10]=20

 Step-by-step=
 guide to adding API key support using Clerk's new public
beta. Covers ge=
nerating cryptographically secure keys, hashing and
storing them safely, =
validating requests in your Next.js API routes,
and building a key manage=
ment UI with rotation and revocation. Full
code examples [11] included. =


 INTRODUCING COWORK (5 MINUTE READ) [12]=20

 Claude Cowork is a ne=
w feature that extends Claude Code to allow
anyone, not just developers, =
to interact with Claude by giving it
direct access to files on their comp=
uter. This allows Claude to read,
edit, or create files within a designat=
ed folder, completing tasks
like organizing documents or drafting reports=
 with enhanced agency.=20

 AGENT OF EMPIRES (GITHUB REPO) [13]=20

 Ag=
ent of Empires is a Rust-written terminal session manager for Linux
and m=
acOS. It functions as a wrapper around tmux, creating a separate
tmux ses=
sion for each AI coding project and ensuring sessions persist
reliably. T=
he tool has a TUI dashboard for visual session management,
including crea=
tion, attachment, detachment, deletion, and group
organization.=20

MISCELLANEOUS

 COST OF BUILDING AN MVP (WITH AI) (7=
 MINUTE READ) [14]=20

 The actual costs of building the AI-powered MVP f=
or a new product,
Lazyweb.com, was $19,100. This included a $13,000 domai=
n name and over
$3,000 spent on various AI models and services like OpenA=
I.=20

 THE KEY TO AGENTIC SUCCESS? BASH IS ALL YOU NEED (7 MINUTE READ) =
[15]


 Minimalist AI agent architectures using simple BASH shells an=
d
modular Unix tools are proving more effective than complex,
over-engi=
neered systems. Vercel, for example, improved its internal
data agent, d0=
, by simplifying its design to use basic BASH commands
for direct file in=
terrogation, resulting in faster, more accurate, and
easier-to-manage ope=
rations.=20

 MANUFACTURING AS CODE IS T=
HE FUTURE, AND THE FUTURE IS NOW (19 MINUTE

 Traditional=
 CAD design is inefficient due to issues with version
control, collaborat=
ion, customization, and automation.=20

 BRING BACK OPINIONATED ARCHITECT=
URE (8 MINUTE READ) [17]=20

 Opinionated architecture is better than ind=
ecisive "it depends" and
"just-in-case" approaches because opinionated ar=
chitecture is clearer
long-term.=20

 LLVM: THE BAD PARTS (20 MINUTE RE=
AD) [18]=20

 The LLVM project has various long-standing issues like insu=
fficient
review capacity, significant code churn, lengthy build times, an=
d
fundamental IR design flaws.=20

 YAML? THAT'S NORWAY PROBLEM (17 MIN=
UTE READ) [19]=20

 The "Norway problem" in YAML, where the country code =
"NO" is
incorrectly parsed as `false`, comes from implicit boolean typing=
 in
older v1.1 specifications that was removed in v1.2, but remains
pre=
valent in 2026 because many popular libraries still adhere to the
older s=
tandard.=20

                                    It's possible to "steal" or reconstruct=
 any React component from a production website, even without access to its =
source code. React Fiber is an internal tree structure in the browser that =
exposes which components create specific DOM elements and what props they r=
eceive. You can generate a component's code by collecting multiple examples=
 of a component's props and its resulting HTML and feeding it into an LLM.

                                    A simple, effective architecture for AI=
 agents is a standard filesystem and Bash tools. Since LLMs have a native u=
nderstanding of code and Unix commands, agents can easily navigate and retr=
ieve information from data structured as files, much like exploring a codeb=
ase. This approach overcomes the limitations of prompt stuffing and impreci=
se vector search by offering natural data hierarchies, exact retrieval, and=
 minimal context loading.

 there's no widespread evidence of increased developer productivity or busi=
