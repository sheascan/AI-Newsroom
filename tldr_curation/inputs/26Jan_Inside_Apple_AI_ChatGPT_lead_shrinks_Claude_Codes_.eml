(18 MINUTE REA=

 Apple's AI efforts have resulted in a Google partnership, man=
agement
changes, and two new versions of Siri. The company had considered=

partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic, but Anthropic wanted too much
mon=
ey, and OpenAI was actively poaching Apple engineers. Google was
willing =
to agree to a financial structure Apple deemed reasonable, and
its techno=

 CHATGPT'S LEAD SHRINKS AS GEMINI SURGES IN AI TR=
AFFIC WAR (9 MINUTE
READ) [6]=20

 ChatGPT's worldwide traffic declined=
 in January as Google's Gemini's
traffic increased. The shift marks a sig=
nificant acceleration of
competitive pressure. ChatGPT had a commanding s=
hare last year, but
its dominance eroded over the course of the year. Gem=
ini's growth
reflects Google's systematic integration across its services=
 and
devices, which creates a distribution advantage through existing
u=
serbases.=20

after one dose, help=

other fats in the blood =

                                    Apple's AI efforts have resulted in a G=
oogle partnership, management changes, and two new versions of Siri. The co=
mpany had considered partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic, but Anthropic wan=
ted too much money, and OpenAI was actively poaching Apple engineers. Googl=
e was willing to agree to a financial structure Apple deemed reasonable, an=
d its technology had improved significantly in recent months. Apple is plan=
ning an announcement for the second half of February that will include demo=
nstrations of the new Siri.
