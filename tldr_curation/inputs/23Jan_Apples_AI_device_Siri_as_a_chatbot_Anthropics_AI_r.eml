the final vers=

                                    Apple is reportedly working on a small,=
 wearable AI pin equipped with multiple cameras, a speaker, and microphones=
. It will likely run the new Siri chatbot the company plans to unveil in iO=
S 27. Apple wants the final version of the pin to be about the same size as=
 an AirTag but slightly thicker. The AI pin could be released as soon as 20=
27, but development is still in the early stages, and the product could be =
canceled.
