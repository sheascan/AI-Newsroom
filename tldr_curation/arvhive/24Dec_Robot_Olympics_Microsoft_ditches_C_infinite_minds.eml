Welcome to Delve Shipmas. Every day this week, Delve is launching a
new A=
I feature to make compliance more modern than ever. Yesterday, we
launche=
d the first-ever AI-native VRM platform. Today, we're
launching... AI SEC=
URITY QUESTIONNAIRE CHROME EXTENSION.

You thought CSV's were bad. Then=
 you opened your first platform
questionnaire and saw a 200-question surp=
rise waiting for you. Today,
Delve is making that go away once and for al=
l with our AI browser
extensions for security questionnaires! Delve's age=
nt auto-extracts
all the questions, answers them based on your reports, p=
olicies, and
tech stack - direclty in your Chrome tab.

See why Bland=
, Wisprflow, Greptile, and over 1000 more trust Delve to
get and stay com=
pliant with SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR and more.

Book a demo here [5] to s=
ee the AI extension in action and get $1,500

 MORAVEC'S PARADOX AND THE ROBO=
T OLYMPICS (11 MINUTE READ) [6]=20

 Many of the things we struggle to pr=
ogram into computers can be
learned from data, but only when that data is=
 available. If we can't
learn from data, we are forced to program it in a=
t lower performance.
Computers can learn any skill, but only with enough =
data, and we don't
want to have to need huge amounts of data for every si=
ngle task. As
models get better, they will need less data to learn new ta=
sks, and
when this happens, we'll finally be able to build truly general=

methods that combine physical understanding and cognition.=20

 MICROS=
OFT WANTS TO REPLACE ITS ENTIRE C AND C++ CODEBASE, PERHAPS BY
2030 (3 MI=
NUTE READ) [7]=20

 Microsoft is hiring staff to translate its codebase f=
rom C and C++ to
Rust. It plans to combine AI and algorithms to rewrite i=
ts biggest
code bases. The engineer will be expected to work on the tools=

Microsoft is building to complete the project. The candidate will have=

to work three days a week in Microsoft's Redmond office. The role pays=

between $139,900 and $274,700 a year.=20

 SINGLE INJECTION TRANSFORMS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM =
INTO A CANCER-KILLING
MACHINE (7 MINUTE READ) [8]=20

 An Australian te=
am has discovered a way to transform normal T cells
into supersoldiers in=
 the body. The treatment helped four people with
stubborn blood cancer go=
 into remission for up to five months. The
trial marks a step towards the=
 next revolution in CAR T therapy. CAR T
cells are usually made outside t=
he body, and making them is costly for
both the body and wallet. The dura=
bility of the new therapy, its
longevity, and immune side effects still n=
eed to be studied, but the
trials highlight the promise of a one-and-done=
 therapy for deadly
blood cancers.=20

 THE ML DRUG DISCOVERY STARTUP T=

(LEASH BIO) (33 MINUTE READ) [9] =


 Leash Bio is a Utah-based startup that aims to build big datasets of=

small-molecules x protein interactions and train a model on it, then
u=
se the trained model to design a drug. The startup has a nearly
pathologi=
cal design to make sure its models are learning the correct
thing. The st=
artup has produced a lot of interesting artifacts from
its line of resear=
ch. This post looks at a few of the discoveries the
startup has made.=20

 INTERVIEWING=
 FOR ML/AI ENGINEERS (16 MINUTE READ) [10]=20

 The ML Systems Design int=
erview, as an interview type, is very easy
to do badly. Some companies ru=
n a parody of the Big Tech interview
process, while others clearly have t=
hought deeply about what they
want, but they still don't conduct effectiv=
e interviews. The interview
process should be robust enough to avoid bein=
g fooled by people who
are good at talking, but still accurate enough to =
calibrate the
candidate's level as well as willingness to push out-of-ban=
d offers.
The best pitch for a candidate is to present to them a slate of=

talented and thoughtful interviewers who could be their future
co-work=
ers, and an interview process rigorous enough to assure them
that their c=
o-workers have been thoroughly examined.=20

 ON FRIDAY DEPLOYS: SOMETIME=

 Deploy freezes a=
re a workaround, not a virtue. It's possible to evade
the high-stakes per=

by freezing merges and =
letting people work on other things, and also
not freezing deploys unless=
 your goal is to test deploy freezes. We
often forget about the outages a=

inaction. Just run the deploy process =
as usual, but don't ship new

 Eve=

build chatb=

 WHAT JOBS ARE MADE OF (6 MINUTE READ) [13=

 Early-career roles are traditionally more execution-heavy. Over ti=

contribution tends to shift toward judgment and agency. AI systems ar=
e
making faster progress on execution than on defining problems,
choosi=
ng what to work on, and navigating ambiguity. This
disproportionately aff=
ects entry-level hiring as the execution layer
becomes cheaper and thinne=
r.=20

                                    Many of the things we struggle to progr=
am into computers can be learned from data, but only when that data is avai=
lable. If we can't learn from data, we are forced to program it in at lower=
 performance. Computers can learn any skill, but only with enough data, and=
 we don't want to have to need huge amounts of data for every single task. =
As models get better, they will need less data to learn new tasks, and when=
 this happens, we'll finally be able to build truly general methods that co=
mbine physical understanding and cognition.

ighlight the promise of a one-and-done therapy for deadly blood cancers.

                                    The ML Systems Design interview, as an =
interview type, is very easy to do badly. Some companies run a parody of th=
e Big Tech interview process, while others clearly have thought deeply abou=
t what they want, but they still don't conduct effective interviews. The in=
terview process should be robust enough to avoid being fooled by people who=
 are good at talking, but still accurate enough to calibrate the candidate'=
s level as well as willingness to push out-of-band offers. The best pitch f=
or a candidate is to present to them a slate of talented and thoughtful int=
erviewers who could be their future co-workers, and an interview process ri=
gorous enough to assure them that their co-workers have been thoroughly exa=
mined.

                                    Early-career roles are traditionally mo=
re execution-heavy. Over time, contribution tends to shift toward judgment =
and agency. AI systems are making faster progress on execution than on defi=
ning problems, choosing what to work on, and navigating ambiguity. This dis=
proportionately affects entry-level hiring as the execution layer becomes c=
heaper and thinner.
