 FINTECH FIRM MERCURY APPLIES FOR NATIONAL BANK CHARTER (5 M=
INUTE
READ) [5]=20

 Business banking startup Mercury has applied for a=
 national bank
charter, a move that would let it offer core banking servi=
ces directly
rather than relying on sponsor banks. The company has submit=
ted
applications to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the=

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., positioning itself to operate like a
=
traditional lender while retaining software-driven revenue streams. If
ap=
proved, Mercury plans to expand into lending and believes the
charter wou=

loosens under th=
e current administration.=20

 Blacksto=

signal Revolut's push upmarket as=
 it hires bankers and private capital
specialists to serve high-net-worth=
 clients. If finalized, the tie-up
would underscore how firms led by exec=
utives like Jon Gray are
increasingly using fintech distribution to reach=
 wealthy and retail
investors, following similar moves by players such as=
 Trade Republic,

 Fi=

a shor=

with $9.2 million in =
funding, the product aimed to reframe credit card
rewards around homeowne=

cardholders began reporting wides=

                                    Business banking startup Mercury has ap=
plied for a national bank charter, a move that would let it offer core bank=
ing services directly rather than relying on sponsor banks. The company has=
 submitted applications to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency an=
d the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., positioning itself to operate like a=
 traditional lender while retaining software-driven revenue streams. If app=
roved, Mercury plans to expand into lending and believes the charter would =
remove a lingering trust hurdle as fintech regulation loosens under the cur=
rent administration.

d its Homeowners Card, ending a short-lived experiment that let users earn =
points on mortgage payments and everyday home-related spending. Launched in=
 late 2024 with $9.2 million in funding, the product aimed to reframe credi=
t card rewards around homeownership rather than travel or dining, but cardh=
olders began reporting widespread transaction declines before accounts were=
 fully shut down. The closure highlights how difficult it remains to sustai=
nably align credit rewards with large, low-margin payments like mortgages, =
even as competitors like Bilt prepare to enter the space.
