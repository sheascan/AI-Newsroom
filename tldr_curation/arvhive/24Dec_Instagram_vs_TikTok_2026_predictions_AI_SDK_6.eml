 DELVE SHIPMAS DAY 2: AI VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [4]=20

 Welcom=
e to Delve Shipmas. Every day this week, Delve is launching a
new AI feat=
ure to make compliance more modern than ever. Yesterday, we
launched Delv=
e's AI Copilot that can help on any compliance task or
question. Today, w=
e're launching... AI VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT

Vendor risk management is =
_painful_. Dozens of vendors, endless
questionnaires, and unclear risk le=
vels. Delve's AI VRM handles this
automatically by auto-gathering securit=
y evidence from each vendor,
creating creating findings, and giving you a=
 clear view of your risk
posture. Leave spreadsheets and legacy platforms=
 in the past and enter
the future of risk with Delve AI.
Join companies=
 like 11x, micro1, Bland, Wisprflow and more.

 INSTAGRAM'S ADAM MOSSERI ON HO=

E READ) [6]=20

 Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, still wasn't sure how p=
eople would
use Instagram's TV app on Amazon Fire the day before the inte=
gration
rolled out. The team knew they would get things wrong, but they w=
ere
ready to learn and iterate quickly. Instagram is likely to change
d=
ramatically in the next few years. The platform plans to let users
proact=

fundamentally =
different.=20

 IT SURE SEEMS LIKE THE FOLDABLE IPHONE WILL BE A WIDE BOI=
 (3 MINUTE
READ) [7]=20

 Apple's Foldable iPhone is rumored to have an=
 aspect ratio similar to
that of Apple's largest iPads when viewed in lan=
dscape mode. It is
expected to arrive in the fall of 2026 along with the =
iPhone 18 Pro. A
wider foldable could help distinguish the device from An=
droid
book-style foldables. Samsung is apparently planning to release its=

own foldable with a wide aspect ratio in Q3 2026 to compete with the
f=
oldable iPhone.=20

 SCIENTISTS FIND A WAY TO 'REBOOT' VISION IN ADULTS WITH LAZY EYE (2
M=
INUTE READ) [8]=20

 Lazy eye, or amblyopia, can occur when one eye is de=
prived of vision
early in life. The lack of input disrupts synapse format=
ion in the
brain's primary visual cortex, weakening vision in that eye. A=
 new
mouse study has found that briefly and reversibly anesthetizing the=

retina of an amblyopic eye for just a few days can restore the brain's=

visual responses to that eye. While it is clear that the treatment
see=
ms to reset the way the brain engages with specific neurons,
scientists s=
till haven't figured out exactly why this is happening.=20

 =
Laptop designs need to be upgraded to make running AI models locally
poss=
ible. The average laptop is underpowered for large language
models. The m=
ost obvious way to boost a PC's AI performance is to
place a powerful NPU=
 alongside the CPU. Another upgrade required for
PCs to run AI models is =
a unified memory architecture that provides
all system resources to the s=
ame pool of memory over a fast,
interconnected memory bus.=20

wasn't sure how people would use Instagram's TV app on Amazon Fire the day =
before the integration rolled out. The team knew they would get things wron=

 change dramatically in the next few years. The platform plans to let users=
 proactively shape content on their feeds in a way that will feel fundament=

                                    Lazy eye, or amblyopia, can occur when =
one eye is deprived of vision early in life. The lack of input disrupts syn=
apse formation in the brain's primary visual cortex, weakening vision in th=
at eye. A new mouse study has found that briefly and reversibly anesthetizi=
ng the retina of an amblyopic eye for just a few days can restore the brain=
's visual responses to that eye. While it is clear that the treatment seems=
 to reset the way the brain engages with specific neurons, scientists still=
 haven't figured out exactly why this is happening.
