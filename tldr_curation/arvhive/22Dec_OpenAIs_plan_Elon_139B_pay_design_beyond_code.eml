 Sam Altman recently appeared =
on Big Technology Podcast to discuss
OpenAI's strategy to win, where the =
product lineup is going in the
coming year, how OpenAI's over $1 trillion=
 in AI infrastructure
commitments make sense, and the company's future pl=
ans for AI devices
and AI cloud. The strategy to keep OpenAI ahead involv=
es getting
people to use its products, keeping them there with the best m=
odels,
serving the use cases they want with reliable compute, then expand=
ing
into areas like enterprise and hardware. The full conversation, along=

with links to the audio, is available in the article.=20

=
 Tesla won its fight over Elon Musk's record-breaking pay package
approve=

lower cour=
t's ruling would have deprived Musk of compensation for
several years of =
work, so he should get the full pay package. Musk's
2018 stock options ha=
ve grown in value to $139 billion. It was
initially valued at more than $=
2.3 billion, already shattering
previous compensation records.=20

 The Trump=

at least $80 b=

money will support=
 the construction of a type of pressurized water
reactor developed by Wes=

 THE BIG-O COMPLEXITY OF VIBE CODERS (4 MINUTE READ) [11]=20

 E=
fficiency becoming a metric will create pressure and cause
exploration to=
 look wasteful. High-token sessions will start to look
sloppy. Over time,=
 AI will turn into another optimization target, and
eventually into somet=
hing that people virtue signal about rather than
something that reflects =
real impact. Some of the most valuable work
exists in the messy, high-tok=
en exploratory phase that resists easy
measurement.=20

 DESIGN IS MORE=
 THAN CODE (9 MINUTE READ) [12]=20

 Design is about finding the right pr=
oblem, the right intent, and the
right vision. The features you design an=
d build today should be
considered a step toward that vision. Without the=
 right context and
goal, you could be iterating toward a direction that w=
asn't chosen
intentionally. The industry is not very patient, but that do=
esn't mean
you should devalue the why behind your designs in favor of out=
put.=20

                                    Sam Altman recently appeared on Big Tec=
hnology Podcast to discuss OpenAI's strategy to win, where the product line=
up is going in the coming year, how OpenAI's over $1 trillion in AI infrast=
ructure commitments make sense, and the company's future plans for AI devic=
es and AI cloud. The strategy to keep OpenAI ahead involves getting people =
to use its products, keeping them there with the best models, serving the u=
se cases they want with reliable compute, then expanding into areas like en=
terprise and hardware. The full conversation, along with links to the audio=
, is available in the article.

cord-breaking pay package approved by shareholders in 2018. The Delaware Su=

                                    Software quality startup Graphite has b=
een acquired by code generation startup Cursor. Graphite started out as Scr=

ns around Graphite started right before the pandemic lockdowns. The team st=
arted working in person together as soon as it was advisable, allowing them=
 to knit a culture early and build trust. The three founders took three dis=
tinct roles, and they all remain vital to the company.
