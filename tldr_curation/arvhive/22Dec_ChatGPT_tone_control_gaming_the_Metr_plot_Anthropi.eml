 RETROFITTING LEGACY SYS=
TEMS FOR AI (SPONSOR) [4]=20

 Many financial systems of record (like ERP=
) were built at a time when
AI tools were the stuff of science fiction. N=
ow, they need to work
together.

On the latest episode of Unpack Pric=
ing [4], Metronome CEO Scott Woody
talks with Rillet CEO Nicolas Kopp abo=
ut why old financial systems
often have a "garbage in, garbage out" probl=
em for modern companies
running AI.

They get into why gen AI is famo=
usly bad with numbers [4](and where it
actually helps), why 20 years of f=
inance experience might now be a
hiring red flag, and how one customer we=
nt from six-month pricing
changes to two-hour launches.=C2=A0

 OpenAI has introduc=
ed new personalization options in ChatGPT, letting
users adjust enthusias=
m, warmth, and emoji use directly. These
controls, available in the Perso=
nalization menu, offer "More," "Less,"
or "Default" settings, expanding t=

 CURSOR ACQUIRES GRAPHITE (2 MINUTE READ) [6]=20

 Cursor has acquired Gr=

 INTRODUCING BLOOM: AN OPEN SOURCE =
TOOL FOR AUTOMATED BEHAVIORAL
EVALUATIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [7]=20

 Anth=
ropic's Bloom is an open-source tool for generating automated
behavioral =
evaluations of AI models. Bloom assesses specific behaviors
like self-pre=
ferential bias and sabotage by creating scenarios and
quantifying behavio=
r occurrence across models. It efficiently
differentiates between aligned=
 and misaligned models and correlates
strongly with human judgment, enabl=

 THE CHANGING DRIVERS OF LLM ADOPTION (15 MINUTE=
 READ) [8]=20

 LLM use is rising. People are increasingly using differen=
t LLMs,
different products, and in different places. ChatGPT remains domi=
nant
and keeps acquiring new users, but Gemini's growth has been faster=

over the last few months. OpenAI's revenue seems to be on track, but
c=
onsumer revenue is likely decreasing as a share. A substantial share
of w=
orkplace AI use involves workers adopting tools on their own
rather than =
waiting for employer-provided access.=20

 EVALUATING CONTEXT COMPRESSION=
 FOR AI AGENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [9]=20

 What happens when agents run out=
 of memory determines whether they
continue productively or have to start=
 from scratch. This post
explores an evaluation framework that measures h=
ow much context
different compression strategies preserve. Structured sum=
marization
retains more useful information than alternative methods witho=
ut
sacrificing compression efficiency.=20

 UNDERSTANDING AI BENCHMARKS=
 (25 MINUTE READ) [10]=20

 Benchmarks are the most widely misunderstood =
part of the AI
ecosystem. The narrative keeps implying a universal increa=
se in
intelligence, but the numbers can be misleading. To navigate this=

noise, look at the aggregate, look at the relative, and verify with
yo=
ur own tasks. The only benchmark that matters at the end of the day
is yo=
ur own workload.=20

 EXPERIMENT DIARY (3 MINUTE READ) [11]=20

 This d=
ocument contains a diary for an experiment aimed at teaching an
LLM using=
 GRPO to generate regex given a description. It details the
performance, =
learnings, modifications, and key takeaways from each
experiment. The ini=
tial training run was on December 17. It saw the
model quickly learning h=
ow to generate valid regex tags, but the model
was basically generating r=
andom regex strings.=20

                                    LLM use is rising. People are increasin=
gly using different LLMs, different products, and in different places. Chat=
GPT remains dominant and keeps acquiring new users, but Gemini's growth has=
 been faster over the last few months. OpenAI's revenue seems to be on trac=
k, but consumer revenue is likely decreasing as a share. A substantial shar=
e of workplace AI use involves workers adopting tools on their own rather t=
