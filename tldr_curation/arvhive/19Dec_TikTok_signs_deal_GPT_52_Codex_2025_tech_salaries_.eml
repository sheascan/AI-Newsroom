vital economic and security interests, unleash commercial development,=

and lay the foundation for a new space age. There are no concrete

 Cloudflare's most recent outage wa=

but global configuration change. The inc=
ident shows why the largest
systems in the world will have to implement s=
afer ways to roll out
configs. Implementing gradual rollouts for all conf=
iguration files is
a lot of work, so it doesn't make sense unless the sta=
bility of
systems is more important than fast iteration. Smaller companie=
s and
products probably won't need to implement staged configuration
ro=
llouts because the infrastructure work slows down product

hows why the largest systems in the world will have to implement safer ways=
 to roll out configs. Implementing gradual rollouts for all configuration f=
iles is a lot of work, so it doesn't make sense unless the stability of sys=
tems is more important than fast iteration. Smaller companies and products =
probably won't need to implement staged configuration rollouts because the =
infrastructure work slows down product development.
