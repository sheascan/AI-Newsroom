 DELVE S=
HIPMAS DAY 2: AI VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [4]=20

 Welcome to Del=
ve Shipmas. Every day this week, Delve is launching a
new AI feature to m=
ake compliance more modern than ever. Yesterday, we
launched Delve's AI C=
opilot that can help on any compliance task or
question. Today, we're lau=
nching... AI VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT

Vendor risk management is _painful=
_. Dozens of vendors, endless
questionnaires, and unclear risk levels. De=
lve's AI VRM handles this
automatically by auto-gathering security eviden=
ce from each vendor,
creating creating findings, and giving you a clear v=
iew of your risk
posture. Leave spreadsheets and legacy platforms in the =
past and enter
the future of risk with Delve AI.
Join companies like 11=
x, micro1, Bland, Wisprflow and more.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 YOUR YEAR WITH CHATGPT (2 MINUTE READ) [6]=20
=

 OpenAI introduced a personalized year-in-review feature called "Your
=
Year with ChatGPT," available to eligible users in select regions.
Inspir=
ed by Spotify Wrapped, the feature highlights individual usage
trends fro=
m the past year.=20

 Z.AI LAUNCHES GLM-4.7, NEW SOTA OPEN-SOURCE MODEL F=
OR CODING (2
MINUTE READ) [7]=20

 GLM-4.7 is the latest release in Z.A=
I's General Language Model line.
The high-end foundation model is aimed a=
t advanced reasoning, coding,
and multimodal workloads. The late update e=
xpands context handling and
reasoning depth compared to earlier versions.=
 It introduced upgraded
reasoning pipelines and broader multimodal suppor=
t.=20

 MINIMAX M2.1 IS LIVE IN KILO (3 MINUTE READ) [8]=20

 MiniMax M=
2.1 is ahead of DeepSeek and Kimi on several benchmarks. It
is even catch=
ing up to state-of-the-art models in some areas. The
model is super-fast =
and efficient. It is now available to all Kilo
Code users.=20

 INTRODU=
CING MANUS DESIGN VIEW (3 MINUTE READ) [9]=20

 Manus Design View is an e=
xtension of the Manus agent for seamless AI
design workflows. It enables =
designers to generate concepts with
simple prompts, make precise edits us=
ing the Mark Tool, and change
text easily. The Manus mobile app allows de=
sign edits on-the-go with
either text or voice input. It is available to =
all users today.=20

NING ATLAS AGAINST PROMPT INJECTION (13 MINUTE READ) [10]=20

 This post =
details OpenAI's ongoing efforts to secure its AI browser,
Atlas, against=
 prompt injection attacks - malicious instructions
embedded in web conten=
t that manipulate agent behavior. While
mitigation techniques are improvi=
ng, the company acknowledged prompt
injection remains an unsolved and per=
sistent threat, particularly as
agent capabilities expand on the open web=
.=20

 ASYNC CODING AGENTS "FROM SCRATCH" (10 MINUTE READ) [11]=20

 It=
's pretty easy to homebrew your own asynchronous coding agent. This
means=
 that businesses selling coding agents can no longer
differentiate themse=
lves by only running sandboxed agents in the cloud
that connect to Slack.=
 Companies working on coding agents likely
realize this and are doing eve=
rything they can to train their own SWE
agents and auxiliary models to im=
prove their harnesses.=20

 WHAT (I THINK) MAKES GEMINI 3 FLASH SO GOOD A=
ND FAST (8 MINUTE READ)
[12]=20

 Gemini 3 Flash is a lightweight, effi=
cient model optimized for speed
and low latency. It is capable of deliver=
ing performance comparable to
Gemini 3 Pro at a fraction of the cost. The=
 model's design brings
unprecedented power but introduces specific tradeo=
ffs in token
efficiency and reliability. This post takes a look at the le=
aked
architectural details of the new model.=20

 WE REMOVED 80% OF OUR=
 AGENT'S TOOLS (4 MINUTE READ) [13]=20

 Vercel spent months building a s=
ophisticated internal text-to-SQL
agent with specialized tools, heavy pro=
mpt engineering, and careful
context management. It kind of worked, but i=
t was fragile, slow, and
required constant maintenance. The team then del=
eted most of it and
stripped the agent down to a single tool that execute=
d arbitrary bash
commands. Its agent got simpler and better at the same t=
ime: it had a
100% success rate instead of 80%.=20

 AI's utility in the coming decade will come from u=
nderstanding the
technology's strengths and where it can be used to augme=
nt human
ability. It won't replace humans, at least in the short term, be=
cause
we are too complex. However, the technology will eventually conquer=

territories we thought were exclusively ours. This will be the first

tructure for foundation models. It features separation of programming and e=
xecution, separation of environment and training code, and seamless transit=
ion from training to inference. The platform enables users to perform RL tr=
aining and inference without requiring local GPU resources by separating cl=
ient-side programming from server-side execution. It provides a high-level =
Python API that abstracts away the complexity of distributed systems.
